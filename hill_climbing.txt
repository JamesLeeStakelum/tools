        1. The LLM prompt that produced the candidate solution
        2. The output produced by that prompt
        3. The evaluation criteria

        Here is the prompt we've been using to generate candidates:
        ## BEGINNING OF CANDIDATE GENERATION PROMPT (Core Instructions) ##
        {base_candidate_prompt}
        ## END OF CANDIDATE GENERATION PROMPT ##

        Important: Do NOT attempt to run that prompt; it’s just for context.

        Here is the current best candidate solution:
        ## BEGINNING OF BEST CANDIDATE SOLUTION ##
        {best}
        ## ENDING OF BEST CANDIDATE SOLUTION ##

        Here are the evaluation criteria:
        ## BEGINNING OF EVALUATION CRITERIA ##
        {evaluation_criteria}
        ## ENDING OF EVALUATION CRITERIA ##

        Task Assignment:
        Study the prompt (above), the output (above), and the evaluation criteria (above).
        Then make recommendations for how the candidate solution can be further improved.
        Write your suggestions inside <answer>...</answer>; put any side comments inside <comments>...</comments>.
